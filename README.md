# CS350


*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.*
The final project was implementing code to make a functioning prototype thermometer that used multiple embedded peripherals to display the different states of the machine and control the thermostat.
*What did you do particularly well?*
All of the functions worked well and did what they needed to do.
*Where could you improve?*
I would like to improve my knowledge on the breadboard itself. While not the primary focus of the class, I enjoyed creating the hardware.
*What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?*
Linux experience with the raspberry pi was new information. It helped me become more comfortable using terminal which I haven't been able to explore as much as I would want.
*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?*
New python experience and all of the different peripherals that we used and how they are utilized. 
*How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*
Using the state machine makes the coding much easier and keeps the code clean.
